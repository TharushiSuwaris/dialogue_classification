This study investigates how stylistic features in dialogue vary across generations and whether these
can be used to classify conversations as youth-like
or old-like. Using a dataset of age-labeled dialogues, the features are extracted such as average
utterance length, swear word usage, filler word frequency, vocabulary overlap, and lexical repetition.
Two machine learning models, Logistic Regression
and XGBoost, are trained on the Young-Young (YY) and Old-Old (O-O) dialogues to perform binary
classification. These models are then applied to
cross-generational (Old-Young (O-Y)) dialogues
to examine how they are categorized, and which
features influence the decisions. SHAP analysis
is employed to interpret model outputs and identify the most impactful linguistic parameters. The
findings show that swear word frequency plays a
key role in classification, while filler words and
vocabulary usage also contribute. This research
highlights how machine learning can model agerelated language variation and provide insight into
cross-generational communication styles.
